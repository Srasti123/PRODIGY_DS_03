📝 Task 3 – Decision Tree Classifier
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The goal is to build a Decision Tree Classifier that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product/service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

We used the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains details about customers, their interactions, and purchase outcomes.

🚀 Steps Involved

1. Dataset Loading & Cleaning
* Imported the dataset using Pandas.
* Handled missing values and categorical variables.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Explored customer demographics and behavior patterns.
* Visualized relationships between features and target variable.

3. Data Preprocessing
* Converted categorical data to numerical using encoding.
* Split dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Model Building – Decision Tree Classifier
* Trained a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn.
* Tuned hyperparameters to avoid overfitting.

5. Model Evaluation
* Evaluated performance with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
* Compared predictions with actual outcomes.

📊 Key Insights

1. Customers with certain age groups and job types were more likely to purchase.

2. Previous marketing campaign outcomes strongly influenced decisions.

3. Decision Tree helps businesses focus on potential buyers, saving time and effort.
